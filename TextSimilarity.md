# Text Similarity

## **What is Text Similarity?**
Text similarity is a way to measure how similar or related two pieces of text are. This is important in tasks like:
- Search engines (finding relevant results)
- Plagiarism detection
- Chatbots and recommendation systems

Several mathematical methods help compute text similarity. Below are the most common ones.

## **1. Cosine Similarity**
Cosine similarity measures the **angle** between two text vectors. It is widely used in NLP because it ignores the length of sentences and focuses only on their direction.

### **How It Works:**
- Convert text into numerical vectors (e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings)
- Compute the cosine of the angle between these vectors
- The closer the angle to **0¬∞, the more similar** the texts

### **Formula:**
\[
\text{Cosine Similarity} = \frac{A \cdot B}{||A|| \times ||B||}
\]
where **A** and **B** are text vectors.

### **Example:**
Text 1: "I love coding."
Text 2: "I enjoy programming."
- After vectorization, cosine similarity score might be **0.85**, showing high similarity.

### **Best For:**
- Document similarity
- Sentence comparison in NLP applications (e.g., chatbots, plagiarism detection)

## **2. Jaccard Similarity**
Jaccard similarity measures how much two sets (words, characters, or bigrams) **overlap**.

### **How It Works:**
- Convert texts into sets of words
- Compute the ratio of **common words** to the **total unique words**

### **Formula:**
\[
\text{Jaccard Similarity} = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|}
\]
where **A** and **B** are sets of words.

### **Example:**
Text 1: "I love programming."
Text 2: "I enjoy programming."
- Words in Text 1: {I, love, programming}
- Words in Text 2: {I, enjoy, programming}
- Jaccard similarity = \(\frac{2}{4} = 0.5\)

### **Best For:**
- Short text comparisons (e.g., product names, social media posts)
- Finding similar users (e.g., people with common friends, common interests)

---
## **3. Euclidean Distance**
Euclidean distance measures the **straight-line distance** between two text vectors in space.

### **How It Works:**
- Convert text into numerical vectors
- Compute the distance between two vectors using the Euclidean formula

### **Formula:**
\[
\text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{\sum (A_i - B_i)^2}
\]
where **A** and **B** are text vectors.

### **Example:**
Text 1: "AI is amazing."
Text 2: "AI is wonderful."
- If vector representations of these texts are close in space, Euclidean distance will be small.

### **Best For:**
- Clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means for text grouping)
- When word frequency differences matter

---
## **Other Text Similarity Measures**

### **4. Manhattan Distance**
- Measures distance between vectors along axes (like city blocks)
- Good for categorical text data (e.g., spam vs. non-spam classification)

### **5. Levenshtein Distance (Edit Distance)**
- Counts the number of insertions, deletions, or substitutions needed to convert one string into another
- Used in **spell-checking, DNA sequence matching**

### **6. Word Mover‚Äôs Distance (WMD)**
- Uses word embeddings (like Word2Vec) to measure how much one text needs to "move" to become another
- Best for **semantic text similarity** (e.g., "happy" and "joyful" are similar)

### **7. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**
- Measures how important a word is in a document relative to a corpus
- Used in **search engines, document ranking**

## **Which Similarity Measure Should You Use?**
| Similarity Method       | Best For                          |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Cosine Similarity**  | Long texts, document comparison |
| **Jaccard Similarity** | Short texts, keyword matching  |
| **Euclidean Distance** | Clustering, numerical differences |
| **Levenshtein Distance** | Spell-checking, typo detection  |
| **WMD** | Understanding meaning in sentences |

üöÄ **Conclusion:** Choosing the right similarity measure depends on the use case. Cosine similarity is great for long text, while Jaccard works well for short texts. Euclidean distance helps in clustering, while edit distance is useful for typos.
